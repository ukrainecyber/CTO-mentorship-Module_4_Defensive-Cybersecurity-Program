# CTO Mentoring Program: Module 4

The USAID Cybersecurity for Critical Infrastructure in Ukraine Activity created five repositories with materials developed for CTO mentorship program in 2021.

The fourth module of this program contains useful cybersecurity frameworks on building defensive cybersecurity program and cyber discipline to your organization.

A fact of doing business in today’s hyper-internet-connected world is the need for organizations, regardless of size or sector, to protect their enterprises against a constant onslaught of malicious actors, insider threats, and a slew of other cybersecurity risks. It’s more a matter of “when,” not “if” your organization will face an attack. 

Fortunately, cybersecurity frameworks have been developed that comprise best practices, standards, and guidelines designed to manage risks and combat these threats so you can protect your greatest assets: people, property and data. Even if you are not mandated to adhere to any particular regulations, it still makes sense for your business to be proactive in managing risk. All frameworks include guidance for good cybersecurity hygiene, such as effective inventory and asset management, contingency planning, personnel security, system access control, and staff awareness and training, to list a few. 

To prepare for the aftermath of a cyber incident, frameworks provide incident response guidelines you can follow to recover and try to limit the damage. Establishing a framework can not only help your organization follow best practices, but also bring rigorous cyber discipline to your organization. 

All training materials are prepared in English and Ukrainian languages accompanied with the whitepapers from the international experts in English.

These materials were prepared by Catalisto LLC for the USAID Cybersecurity for Critical Infrastructure in Ukraine Activity.
